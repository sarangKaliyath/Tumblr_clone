          We made it really, really simple for people to make a blog and put
          whatever <br /> they want on it. Stories, photos, GIFs, TV shows,
          links, quips, dumb jokes, <br /> smart jokes, Spotify tracks, mp3s,
          videos, fashion, art, deep stuff. Tumblr <br /> is 536 million
          different blogs, filled with literally whatever.
